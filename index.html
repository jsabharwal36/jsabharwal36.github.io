            <p>Effective road hazard detection is crucial for maintaining infrastructure and ensuring road safety. This tutorial explores the application of YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, for identifying common road hazards such as potholes, sewer covers, and manholes, while also comparing its performance with previous versions, YOLOv5 and YOLOv7, emphasizing computational efficiency and detection accuracy. Key image preprocessing techniques are implemented to enhance performance under varying conditions, including lighting changes, different road types, and hazard characteristics. Hyperparameter tuning, involving adjustments to learning rates, batch sizes, anchor box sizes, and augmentation strategies, is performed to optimize model performance, with evaluations based on Mean Average Precision (mAP) scores, highlighting the model's robustness and generalization across diverse test scenarios. Additionally, the project addresses pothole detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a cost-effective alternative to sensor-based methods. A YOLOv7-based approach, trained on annotated pothole datasets, achieved an F1 score of 0.51, which improved with additional training epochs. Overall, this project demonstrates the value of deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, in enhancing road safety and supporting infrastructure maintenance.</p>
